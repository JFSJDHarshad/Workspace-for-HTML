<!--HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
-->
<p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of lines
    in the source code,
    but the browser
    ignores it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains         a lot of spaces
    in the source         code,
    but the        browser
    ignores it.
    </p>

<!--HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
-->
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
